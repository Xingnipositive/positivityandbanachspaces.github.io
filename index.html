                    <p> We are pleased to announce that the conference on 
                        “Positivity and Banach spaces” will be held at Chern 
                        Institute of Mathematics, Tianjin, P.R.China during 1-5, July 2024. </p>

                    <p> The conference is dedicated to recent developments in Positivity and Banach space 
                        theory in their broadest senses, and to those on the interface between these fields. 
                        The goal of the conference is to bring together experts and younger researchers to discuss 
                        the current and future directions of these developments.  </p>

                    <p> Please note that June 30 is the arrival day and that there will be no talks on this day. Formal talks 
                        are scheduled from July 1 to July 4 (all day), and on the morning of July 5.</p>

                    <p>  We look forward to seeing you at "Positivity and Banach spaces". For more information, please contact the organizing committee

                        <li><strong>From  Beijing Daxing International Airport（PKX） to CIM.</strong> 
                            <p>If you land at Daxing Airport and want to travel to the Tianjin area, 
                                you will have 3 modes of transportation to choose from: taxi, bus and train. 
                                Although taking a taxi from Daxing Airport can be comfortable, the fare can be very high if traffic is heavy. 
                                In comparison, although China's trains are very fast, there is currently no dedicated line connecting Tianjin 
                                to the new airport. Therefore, you need to transfer to 4 high-speed trains and subways, and the journey will be tiring and time-consuming.
                                Finally, take the intercity airport bus and you will reach your destination in approximately 2.5 hours.
                            </p>

                              <p>Taxi.
                                  Currently, Daxing Airport taxis do not offer fixed prices. However, a rough estimate
                                  of the fare for the approximately 130km journey from Daxing Airport to Tianjin city 
                                  center is around 360 yuan (€46/$50), depending on actual traffic conditions and the 
                                  exact drop-off location. In addition, at night, an additional 20% of the fare is 
                                  required. If traffic conditions are good, it takes about 90 minutes to drive to the 
                                  center of Tianjin.</p>
                            
                           <p>Bus.
                               Taking an intercity bus from Daxing Airport to Tianjin is another transportation option. 
                               The entire trip takes about 2.5 hours, and you can either go to Tianjin Tongsha Long-distance 
                               Bus Station (the city's main bus station), or go to the Tianjin West Railway Station bus station 
                               near Tianjin West Railway Station. A one-way ticket costs 75 yuan (9.5 euros/10.5 USD). 
                               After you arrived the Bus Stations, you could take a taxi to Nankai University or follow 
                               the direction No.4.</p>

                            <p><strong>Using your smart phone</strong>In China, Mobile payment has become a daily routine for us. 
                                People hardly use cash. In  shopping malls and hotels, you can still pay by cards.The most commonly used 
                                mobile payment apps are WeChat and Alipay. As more and more foreigners come to China, these two apps can be 
                                linked to non-Chinese credit cards or savings cards. The following links may be useful to you.

                            <p> <strong>Advice: </strong> If you are coming from abroad, please exchange 
                        your currency before arrival or at the airport. Local transportation services 
                        only charge in Renminbi (RMB). You can exchange RMB at a Bank of China anywhere in China. 
                        Note that you need to bring your passport when exchanging RMB. Banks and their airport branches
