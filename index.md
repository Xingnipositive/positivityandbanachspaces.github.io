Welcome to Yuezhao Li's homepage.

I am a PhD candidate in mathematics at Leiden University, Netherlands. My supervisor is [Prof. Dr. Bram Mesland](https://pub.math.leidenuniv.nl/~meslandb2/).

From 2013 to 2018, I studied physics and mathematics at Peking University, China. From 2018 to 2021, I studied mathematics at Georg-August-Universität Göttingen, Germany, specialising in noncommutative geometry and its applications in topological insulators. I wrote my master thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Ralf Meyer](https://www.uni-math.gwdg.de/rameyer/).

I work in the field of noncommutative geometry. Recently, I am focusing on the application of unbounded KK-theory in (noncommutative) differential geometry, following the school of Bram Mesland, Walter van Suijlekom, Jens Kaad, Simon Brain, Adam Rennie and many other mathematicians.

Besides mathematics, I am also an enthusiastic runner.
