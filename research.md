## Research interest

- Unbounded KK-theory and (noncommutative) differential geometry
- KK-theory and (noncommutative) index theory
- Mathematics of topological quantum systems

## Notes

- My seminar notes on [Groupoid C\*-algebras](https://liyuezhao.github.io/notes/groupoid_note.pdf), generated from the Leiden NCG reading seminar on [Groupoid C\*-algebras](https://ncg-leiden.github.io/) in 2022 Fall Semester.
- My seminar notes on [KK-theory](https://liyuezhao.github.io/notes/kk_note.pdf), generated from the Leiden NCG reading seminar on [K(K)-theory](https://liyuezhao.github.io/seminars/2022/02/15/KK-theory/) in 2022 Spring Semester.
