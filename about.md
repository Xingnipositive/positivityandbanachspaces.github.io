Welcome to Yuezhao Li's  homepage.

I am a PhD candidate in mathematics at Leiden University, Netherlands. My supervisor is [Prof. Dr. Bram Mesland](https://pub.math.leidenuniv.nl/~meslandb2/).

From 2013 to 2018, I studied physics and mathematics at Peking University, China. From 2018 to 2021, I studied mathematics at Georg-August-Universität Göttingen, Germany, specialising in noncommutative geometry and its applications in topological insulators. I wrote my master thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Dr, Ralf Meyer](https://www.uni-math.gwdg.de/rameyer/).

My research interest lies in the field of noncommutative geometry and its applications to differential geometry and mathematical physics. I am also a fan of index theory.
